# Poster-Maker
Python Script to generate posters out of the images in directory.

This version is very basic ligthweight code to combine organize images of the directory in a single image.
Demo:

:( The program would crash for large number of images.

Pull request suggestion:
  Symmetric organization of the images in each of the three zones.
  
### Future work:
- Improving the image organization 
- Custom poster background
- Memory efficient algorithm.
